            Cocoanut rice is a staple in most Nigerian homes. However, the way we make it differ from home to home. I have adapted my moms’ delicious recipe and as usual, I added my own spin by using the chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. The broth from the dark meat of the chicken adds more flavor to the coconut rice. (You can remove the skin on the thighs to economize on the fat).

            some use crayfish in their own recipe. Just a small amount of crayfish adds a rich flavor to the rice. If you don’t have crayfish, don’t let that stop you from making this recipe. You can skip it.
            
            Not only is this coconut rice delicious, but it can also be addictive. It also has quite a kick from the habaneros. Not to worry, the heat can easily be controlled by using less habaneros or simply remove the seeds. This will reduce the heat level. Jalapenos can also be used in place of habaneros.
            
            I always love to use the full-fat coconut milk in my coconut rice for that rich coconutty flavor but I’m aware some people like it light; so feel free to use the light coconut milk for a milder coconut flavor but the real thing is so much better! and if you really want to go coco-NUTS, you can garnish lightly with toasted coconut flakes!!
            
            Notes
            
            Be sure to rinse the rice before cooking it. This will reduce the starch content in the rice a bit.
            Cook the rice on a low simmer to prevent it from burning
            The can coconut milk works best for this recipe not the ones in the cold milk section.
            For this recipe, I used basmati rice, however, you can use any type of rice you like but note that cooking time varies for different types of rice.

            <h3>The main ingredients for this fried rice are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice - I prefer Basmati rice for this recipe because it cooks faster, and it’s easy to work with. You can choose to use any rice that suits your taste, but be sure to check for the cooking time as cooking time for different types of rice varies.</li>
            <li>Coconut milk -  For a deeper coconut flavor, use the can coconut milk. For a milder coconut flavor, use the freshly squeezed coconut milk or the ones in the fridge section in the grocery.</li>
            <li>Broth-Mild broth like Chicken broth or vegetable broth works well in this recipe. Avoid using beef broth, which can overpower the flavor of the meal.</li>
            <li>Vegetables - I used bell peppers, sweet corn, peas, and carrots. You c add more or less.</li>
            <li>Protein-My protein of choice today is beef liver. Feel free to use chicken, shrimps, bacon, or sausage.</li>
            <li>Flavoring and Spices - Do not skip the salt and curry powder </li>
        </ul>

            Cocoanut Fried Rice – Rice cooked in broth and coconut milk with lots of vegetables and protein. The end product is an enticing combination of textures, colors, and flavors. It smells heavenly and tastes even better!
            This is a delicious dish of rice cooked in broth and coconut milk and fried in coconut oil with vegetables and protein to make it a full meal.
            This is a different way of preparing fried rice compared to the traditional Asian styles. 
            However, this version goes a bit further because it uses coconut milk, coconut oil, and lots of veggies, which gives the dish a unique flavor and texture.
